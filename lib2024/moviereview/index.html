		<h1>My Favourite Movie: <i>Jumanji (1995)</i></h1>
			<h2><i>Jumanji</i> is a 1995 adventure comedy starring Robin Williams as Alan Parrish, a young boy who gets transported into the world of a mysterious board game, only returning to reality 26 years later, when a pair of orphans pick up the game that he and his childhood friend never finished. With the help of these two children, Judy and Peter, and his now adult childhood friend, Sarah, Alan must finish <i>Jumanji</i> or face the havoc that it wreaks upon the world.</h2>

			<h2>My Favourite Line</h2>
				<p>When young Kirsten Dunst scanned a man's face with a department store item scanner while screaming "PRICE CHECK!", that was the most iconic moment in not just this movie, but all of film history.</p>
